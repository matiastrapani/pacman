# pacman

<p>Pacman game remake in Python and Pygame libs. It was developed in Pyhton 2.7 win version, but with small changes it will work in Linux and also in Python 3.x</p>
<p>The main file is pacman.py this is still WIP. I hope you enjoy. I've started this project just for fun, and to learn python programming.</p>
